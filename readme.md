# Fizz Buzz Implementation Without Conditionals

This code demonstrates a possible Fizz Buzz Kata implementation without using if conditionals and instead working with dictionaries.

The code was implemented via TDD to initially produce the obvious solution using if 
statements and afterwards refactored step-by-step to remove all conditionals and replace them with setting up dictionaries for producing the result.

This solution is only demonstrating alternative implementation approaches and is by way not trying to provide the most efficient nor most readable or maintainable code :-)

***Note***: the amount of data-driven test cases should usually of course not be necessary and are rather provided to demonstrate to the reader that the solution works ;-)
